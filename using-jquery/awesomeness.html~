  During a science lesson, my sister-in-law picked up a magnet and said to her second-grade class, "My name begins with the letter M, and I pick things up. What am I?" A little boy answered, "You're a mommy."<br>

  <H3>Knowing the Territory</H3>
  It was my friend's first camping trip with her husband, and they were lost. He tried all the usual tactics to determine direction-moss on the trees (there was none), direction of the sun (it was overcast), and so on. Just as she began to panic, he spotted a cabin in the distance.<br>
  "This way, " he said as he led her back to their camp.<br>
  "How did you do that?" my friend asked.<br>
  "Simple. In this part of the country, the satellite dishes point south."
