  <h3>Intro</h3>
      So, while I might be preaching to the choir here, we're going to take a quick look at why a developer might choose to use jQuery. My point in doing this is to foster your basic knowledge of jQuery by first explaining the "why" before we look at the "how."

  <h3>Here is a list of attributes that builds a case for why you should use jQuery:</h3>
      1. It's open source, and the project is licensed under an MIT and a GNU General Public License (GPL) license. It's free, yo, in multiple ways!<br>
      2. It's small (18 KB minified) and gzipped (114 KB, uncompressed).<br>
      3. It's incredibly popular, which is to say it has a large community of users and a healthy amount of contributors who participate as developers and evangelists.<br>
      4. It normalizes the differences between web browsers so that you don't have to.<br>
      5. It's intentionally a lightweight footprint with a simple yet clever plugin architecture.<br>
      6. Its repository of plugins is vast and has seen steady growth since jQuery's release.<br>
      7. Its API is fully documented, including inline code examples, which in the world of JavaScript libraries is a luxury. Heck, any documentation at all was a luxury for years.<br>
      8. It's friendly, which is to say it provides helpful ways to avoid conflicts with other JavaScript libraries.<br>

  <h3>The jQuery Philosophy</h3>
      The jQuery philosophy is “Write less, do more.” This philosophy can be further broken down into three concepts:<br>
      1. Finding some elements (via CSS selectors) and doing something with them (via jQuery methods)<br>
      2. Chaining multiple jQuery methods on a set of elements<br>
      3. Using the jQuery wrapper and implicit iteration<br>

      <H3>Education Starts At Home</H3>
	During a science lesson, my sister-in-law picked up a magnet and said to her second-grade class, "My name begins with the letter M, and I pick things up. What am I?" A little boy answered, "You're a mommy."<br>
	-Robert Boyer, Marion, Indiana<br>
      <H3>Knowing the Territory</H3>
	It was my friend's first camping trip with her husband, and they were lost. He tried all the usual tactics to determine direction-moss on the trees (there was none), direction of the sun (it was overcast), and so on. Just as she began to panic, he spotted a cabin in the distance.<br>
	"This way, " he said as he led her back to their camp.<br>
	"How did you do that?" my friend asked.<br>
	"Simple. In this part of the country, the satellite dishes point south."
